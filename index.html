    <h2>Our Story</h2>
    <p>
        Clyde & Conrad Honey Co. is rooted in the belief that exceptional honey begins with
        healthy bees and respect for the land. Our hives are located in the countryside
        surrounding Adderbury, where bees forage freely among wildflowers, clover, and native plants.
    </p>
    <p>
        We practice small-scale, organic beekeeping without chemicals, pesticides, or artificial feeding.
        Our honey is harvested in limited batches, taking only what the bees can naturally spare.
    </p>
    <p>
        Each jar is bottled fresh and left unfiltered and unheated to preserve its natural flavour,
        aroma, and texture — honey exactly as the bees created it.

    <h2>Why Natural</h2>
    <p>
        We believe all-natural honey offers the best flavour and the purest goodness.
        Free from preservatives, additives, or unnecessary processing, it retains all its
        natural enzymes, aromas, and nutrients.
    </p>
    <p>
        Our honey is raw and unprocessed — straight from the hive to your table, rich in
        flavor and wholesome goodness.
